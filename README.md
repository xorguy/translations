# Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to translate [Weather Line](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id715319015) app into different languages. Translations are done here on Github by app users in exchange for lifetime access to Weather Line. Contact us at team@weatherlineapp.com if you would like to contribute!

# How To

1. Login to Github (create a free account [here](github.com/join))
2. From the [directory](https://github.com/weather-line/translations), click the language file(s) you would like to translate. Each language can have multiple files and each file has different instructions, read them carefully.
3. To start editing, click the pencil icon near the top right.
4. To save progress, scroll to the very bottom, fill in the text boxes, select the option for "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request", then click "propose a file change". This has saved your own version of the file, with your edits, to your github account.
6. To submit your changes, when you have finished editing your own version of the file [open a new pull request](https://github.com/weather-line/translations/pulls).
7. Change "compare:" to your branch name (file name), and click "Create pull request"!
